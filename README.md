# Numerical-integral
I made a script in python to solve integrals numerically. I'm a physics student and I'm learning python and c. I may upload my projects for practice.

This script calculates the area under a curve by approximating it with rectangles. I tried to think of all the errors with bounds and the partiation that could happen.
